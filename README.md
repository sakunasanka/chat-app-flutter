## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the app, try the following steps:

### Version Incompatibility

If the app doesn't work with the specified versions:

1.  **Modify `gradle.properties`**: Open `android/gradle/gradle.properties` and **remove the very last line** from the file.
2.  **Clean Project**: Run the following commands in sequence:
    ```bash
    flutter clean
    flutter pub get
    flutter run
    ```

### Persistent Version Issues

If problems persist due to version issues, you have two options:

1.  **Recheck Versions**: Double-check that all your Flutter, Dart, SDK, NDK, and Java versions exactly match those listed in the Setup section.
2.  **Download Pre-built APK**: As an alternative, you can download the pre-built application from the following Google Drive link:
